title: Burn the Budget
---

# Our Campaign.   
Inspired by [Boldly Bankrupt](https://boldlybankrupt.cargo.site/), we knew that our first priority in demanding from UIC a more equitable education is to **#BurntheBudget.**    

## What we plan to do.   
The problems with UIC are multi-faceted, and as such, we will bring awareness to a range of issues and advocate for numerous changes to be made to the University. Stay in tuned to the website and our social media platforms for upcoming posts, events, and news!
