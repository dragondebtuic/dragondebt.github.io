title: Burn the Budget
---

# Our Campaign.   
Inspired by [Boldly Bankrupt](https://boldlybankrupt.cargo.site/), we knew that our first priority in demanding from UIC a more equitable education is to **#BurntheBudget.**    

## What we plan to do.   
The problems with UIC are multi-faceted, and as such, we seek to bring awareness to a range of issues and advocate for numerous changes to be made to the University. Stay tuned to the website and our social media platforms for upcoming posts, events, and news! 

## How we plan to do it.
#Burningthebudget first starts with mobilization and organizing, our power is in our numbers--the many students and student organizations that want to build a better University. In organizing around UIC's budget, we utilize current and popular aspects of our society to educate others about the budget and to build solidarity with others who have been harmed by the University. We also use data, social media, graphics, memes, videos, and anything else that can clearly communicate the ways the University prioritizes police and other militarized organizations over its students. Through our work, we hope to tap into the collective power of UIC's students, faculty, staff, and the larger community so we can #burnthebudget.
