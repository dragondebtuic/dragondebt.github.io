<h3 id="how-does-uic-allocate-their-funds-">It all starts with UIC's Budget</h3>
<p>A primary focus of this project is to draw attention to and educate about how the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) allocate its funds, and our tuition dollars. To answer this question, we examined UIC&#39;s budget and other public financial documents to illuminate the University&#39;s priorities, especially as the student body and other University departments have been experiencing financial strain and budget cuts. </p>
