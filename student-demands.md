title: Student Demands Letter
---
  
In the summer of 2020, we witnessed a national outcry to defund the police as millions watched police and other carceral systems continue to harm and kill Black and Brown folks only because of the color of their skin. Communities all over the world have been calling attention to and advocated for institutional acknowledgement of the root cause of this violence-- anti-Black racism and White supremacy.   

In response to this public outcry and rising awareness, students at UIC came together and composed a letter of demands that they then provided to UIC administration to not only acknowledge but systematically address the oppression and anti-Blackness experienced by UIC students, faculty, and the larger community.  Below you will find UIC Student Demands Letter.

\*__It is important to note that as of February 2021, the UIC administration has not directly addressed the above letter.__\*
